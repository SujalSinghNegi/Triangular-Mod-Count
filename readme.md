# How to Run the Code

## Easy 2-Step Process

1. **Step 1:**  
   Open the `user_code.cpp` file for C++ or `UserCode.java` for java and write your solution inside the `solve()` function.

2. **Step 2:**  
   Execute the test runner:
   - **For Windows:**  
     You can either open the `run_tests.bat` file (double-click it) or open a terminal in the project directory and type:  
     ```
     ./run_tests.bat
     ```
   - **For Linux/Mac:**  
     Open a terminal in the project directory and type:
     ```
     ./run_tests.sh
     ```

## Test Cases

The test runner automatically processes the three test case files provided in the working directory:

- **test1.in:**  
  A basic test case with simple input values to verify the core functionality of your solution.

- **EdgeCases.in:**  
  This file contains edge cases (for example, minimal values, maximal values, or boundary conditions) to ensure your solution handles all corner scenarios.

- **custom_tests.in:**  
  A comprehensive test file that includes a mix of random and specially crafted input values to stress-test your solutionâ€™s efficiency and correctness under varied conditions.

For each test case, the solution reads the input from the corresponding `.in` file, compares the generated output with the expected output in the `.out` file, and displays whether the test case **PASSED** or **FAILED**.
