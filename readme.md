# Check ODD or EVEN
Mode: Easy

Question: You have given a number N. You have to find out that Sum Up to 0 to N is ODD or EVEN.


Example-> 
For N= 5,
Sum Up to 0 to 5 is  0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 which is Odd.
So answer is ODD.

For N= 8, 
Sum Up to 0 to 8 is  0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 36 which is Even.
So answer is EVEN.


Input Format: The first line contains the number of test cases t;
The second line contains t test cases, each test case contains a number N.


Output Format: For each test case, print "ODD" if the sum is odd, "EVEN" if the sum is even.

The output is strictly in the following way [ALL CAPS] -> for ODD, print "ODD", for EVEN, print "EVEN".

Constraints:

1 <= N <= 2^31

1 <= t <= 10^4
